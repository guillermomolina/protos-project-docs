# I028 — Core Networking Foundation

Status: **IN_PROGRESS**
Normative dependencies: D047 / specification revision `0.1.388` — RATIFIED; D048 / specification revision `0.1.391` — RATIFIED
Consumer: `LIB005 — Networking`

## Purpose

Implement the D047 portable networking foundation without importing host socket
state machines or backend scheduling identities into Protos semantics.

## Entry checkpoint — CLOSED by D048

D048 / specification revision `0.1.391` resolves the only source-visible
construction/recognition protocol intentionally deferred by D047. The approved
surface is ordinary `IpAddress(version, bits)` / `IpEndpoint(address, port)`
factory invocation over canonical frozen prelude factory/prototypes, transparent
exact frozen structural recognition, and explicit `recognizes(value)` predicates.
No hidden semantic family/brand or textual/DNS coercion is introduced.

`I028-A` is therefore READY. Later slices remain bounded by D047/D048 and by the
normal implementation dependencies established as A-F progresses.

## Planned implementation decomposition after the checkpoint

- **A — address/endpoint ordinary-object foundation — IN_PROGRESS:** mechanically subdivided into independently publishable A1/A2/A3 slices without changing D047/D048.
  - **A1 — IpAddress local foundation — CLOSED (`0.2.278-SNAPSHOT` / `SAME_COMMIT`):** source-backed canonical ordinary prototype, `IpAddress(version, bits)` through ordinary invocation, exact unbounded-Integer IPv4/IPv6 validation, transparent `recognizes`, structural `==`/`hash`, frozen successful values and frozen Prelude prototype, plus ordinary-Protos conformance. No `IpEndpoint` or Actor/P transfer.
  - **A2 — IpEndpoint local foundation — CLOSED (`0.2.279-SNAPSHOT` / `SAME_COMMIT`):** canonical frozen ordinary Prelude factory/prototype, recognized-IpAddress + exact unbounded-Integer port validation, transparent recognition, structural equality/hash, exact address retention and ordinary-Protos conformance. No Actor/P transfer.
  - **A3 — Actor/P transfer + close A — READY:** A1/A2 local factories are closed; prove ordinary snapshot/rematerialization across Actor/P preserves canonical parent, exact slots, frozen state and equality/hash, then close A.
- **B — Network capability + bootstrap provisioning:** host-neutral live
  capability shape and optional initial-module `network` endowment; no ambient
  recovery.
- **C — TCP connection + `connectTcp`:** async acquisition, cancellation/late
  resource custody, Byte I/O/close/half-close composition, endpoint observation.
- **D — TCP listener + `listenTcp`:** exact request snapshot/validation,
  `localPort`, concurrent pending accepts, lifecycle/admission behavior.
- **E — production backend portability/scalability:** preserve D047 independently
  of NIO/epoll/kqueue/io_uring/IOCP/Network.framework implementation choices;
  subdivide mechanically if required.
- **F — cross-slice conformance/native-boundary closure:** cancellation races,
  late custody, multiple-accept scale evidence and Actor/P non-transferability.

## I028-A1 closure

Published at implementation version `0.2.278-SNAPSHOT`. The slice is intentionally local:
`IpAddress` is a canonical frozen ordinary Prelude factory/prototype, successful construction
returns a fresh frozen ordinary child with exactly `version` and `bits`, and the bounded
representation bridge enforces exact unbounded-Integer IPv4/IPv6 ranges, transparent
recognition and structural equality/hash without candidate callbacks. Ordinary-Protos
conformance covers construction/freshness/freeze, boundary and fixed-width rejection,
recognition receiver/arity/shape behavior, equality/hash and Map-key coherence. The native
boundary is explicitly re-audited at 119 sites / 31 providers. `IpEndpoint`, Actor/P transfer
and every Network/TCP/backend concern remain untouched.

## I028-A2 closure

Published at implementation version `0.2.279-SNAPSHOT`. `IpEndpoint` is now the second canonical
frozen ordinary D048 data factory/prototype. Successful construction retains the exact supplied
recognized `IpAddress`, validates an exact unbounded Integer port in `1..65535`, publishes exactly
`address` / `port`, and freezes the fresh endpoint. Transparent recognition and structural
endpoint equality/hash inspect only canonical frozen state; equal-but-distinct IpAddress objects
therefore compose into equal endpoint values and coherent Map keys. The bridge reuses A1's direct
IpAddress invariant implementation and advances the audited native boundary to 123 sites /
32 providers. Actor/P transfer remains entirely in A3, which is now READY; every
Network/TCP/backend concern remains untouched.

## Exclusions

DNS, UDP, TLS, QUIC, HTTP/WebSocket, NetworkInterface enumeration, formal policy
attenuation, generic socket options and socket-local deadlines remain outside this
implementation item unless separately approved.
